It just might be the most diverse city on the planet, as it is home to over 8.6 million people and over 800 languages.\nAs quoted in an article \u2014 What Food Tells Us About Culture\n\u201cTraditional cuisine is passed down from one generation to the next. It also operates as an expression of cultural identity.

This project will help to understand the diversity of a neighborhood by leveraging venue data from Foursquare\u2019s \u2018Places API\u2019 and \u2018k-means clustering\u2019 unsupervised machine learning algorithm. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) will help to discover further about the culture and diversity of the neighborhood.\nToday Tourism is one of the pillars of the economy and the people most often visits those countries who are rich in heritage and developed enough from a foreign prospective, like friendly environment.
